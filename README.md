# 2i Lunch and Learn

This is the code repo for the 2i Engineering Lunch and Learn site built using Gatsby. The content repo is available [here](https://github.com/2i-Git/lunch_and_learn_content). When changes are made to the main branch of either repo, Netlify will automatically kick off a new build and serve the changes.

## Getting set up

In order to run this repo locally you will need NVM or NVM-Windows installed on your machine. [This is a good installation guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/nvm-for-windows-how-to-download-and-install-node-version-manager-in-windows-10/).

From the command line, set your Node version to match the one in the .nvmrc file:
```
nvm install 14.16
nvm use 14.16
```

Now you should be able to run `npm install` to install dependencies.

To run the develop built use `npm run dev`.
